# Minecraft Snapshots
every past Minecraft panorama, classic-1.20. At some point i should add the 1.21 and 1.21.4 panoramas, but i don't feel like it rn. made for the Vistas mod, won't work without it.

## How to install
1. you will need the [Vistas](https://modrinth.com/mod/vistas) mod installed in Minecraft, since a vanilla resource pack can only have one panorama. i listed the Vistas mod as a dependency on the releases to make it absolutely clear.
2. just drop it in your `resourcepacks` folder like any other resource pack.
3. after loading it, Vistas will choose a random panorama from the pack and show it on the title screen every time you launch the game.

if you want to set a specific panorama instead, go into the config for the Vistas mod, and enter the id for the panorama you want:

- classic unblurred: `minecraft_snapshots:classic`
- classic blurred: `minecraft_snapshots:classic_blur`
- update aquatic (1.13): `minecraft_snapshots:ocean`
- village and pillage (1.14): `minecraft_snapshots:village`
- buzzy bees (1.15): `minecraft_snapshots:bees`
- nether (1.16): `minecraft_snapshots:nether`
- caves & cliffs, pt 1 (1.17): `minecraft_snapshots:caves`
- caves & cliffs, pt 2 (1.18): `minecraft_snapshots:caves_2`
- the wild (1.19): `minecraft_snapshots:wild`
- trails & tales (1.20): `minecraft_snapshots:trails_and_tales`
- more coming Soon™
